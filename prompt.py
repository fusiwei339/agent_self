moon="""Your spacecraft has just crash-landed on the lighted side of the Mars. You were scheduled to rendezvous with the mother ship 300 miles away on the surface of the moon, but the rough landing has ruined your craft and destroyed all the equipment on board, except for the 15 items listed below. Your crewâ€™s survival depends on reaching the mother ship, so you must choose the most critical items available for the 300-mile trip. Your task is to rank the 15 items in terms of their importance for survival. Place a 1 by the most important item, a 2 by the second-most important item, and so on through 15, the least important. The items are:
    1. Flashlight
    2. Jackknife
    3. Air map of the area
    4. Plastic raincoat
    5. Magnetic compass
    6. Compress kit w/ gauze
    7. .45-caliber pistol
    8. Parachute (red, white)
    9. Bottle of salt tablets
    10. 1 qt. of water/person
    11. Animals book
    12. Sunglasses per person
    13. 2 quarts of vodka
    14. 1 topcoat per person
    15. Cosmetic mirror
Share your individual solutions and consult with your group members to reach a consensus ranking for each of the 15 items that best satisfies all group members. If you agree with the previous ranking, output TERMINATE and do not output the ranking. If you make changes on the list, output a new list.

    In the group writing project you just completed, four team members contributed to the project. Some members contributed more, while others contributed less.
